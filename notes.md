- User requirements
  - chose one of the three choices available and see the result on screen
  - handle wins, loses and tie 
- Process of thinking
  - when user chooses one of the options, it should be recorded on a variable which holds the numeric value (0-2),
  - then generate a random number for the PC choice and store it in other variable
  - then generate the url for the winner page with the previous values ie( /winner.html?user=0&computer=1 -> user: rock, PC: paper, PC wins)
